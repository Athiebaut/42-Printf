ft_printf

ft_printf is a core project of the 42 curriculum that aims to recreate the standard C printf function from scratch.
The project focuses on understanding variadic functions, format string parsing, and low-level output management using system calls.
It requires designing clean, modular, and extensible code capable of handling multiple format specifiers while strictly matching the behavior of the original printf.
