ft_printf

ft_printf is a system-level programming project that focuses on recreating a simplified version of the standard C printf function.
The main objective is to understand how formatted output works internally, including format parsing, argument handling, and low-level data representation.

This project introduces variadic functions and requires designing modular, extensible code capable of handling multiple data types and formatting behaviors. A strong emphasis is placed on code structure and maintainability, as the function is meant to be reused across multiple projects.

ft_printf strengthens problem-solving skills related to abstraction, formatting logic, and output handling, while reinforcing disciplined C programming practices and attention to detail.
